The goal of this level is to identify human readable files.

After sshing into the server, when we run ls, we see only **inhere** directory present. Hence, we change into that directory and run

```
ls -a 
```

and find that there are 9 files. One of them contains human readable data. To find which one we need to know a few things.

The file command in linux shows information about what type of file something is. For example, when we run 

```
file ./-file00
```

we get this as output 

```
./-file00: data
```

That means that that file contains binary data. When a file contains something readable, it shows up as ASCII text. So, we run the file command on all files with 

```
file ./*
```

and find that **-file07** contains ASCII text. When we read it we get that password i.e **lrIWWI6bB37kxfiCQZqUdOIYfr6eEeqR**.

If there were a lot more files, we can find the ones contains ASCII text as follows

```
file ./* | grep ASCII
```

grep is a utility for finding a piece of text in a files. We use **|** special character to take the output from **file ./\*** to grep ASCII command.
