The goal of this level is to submit the password of this level to localhost:30000.

We first find the password for bandit 14 by reading the file `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14` that was mentioned in the previous level.
**fGrHPx402xGC7U7rXKDaxiWFTOiF0ENq**.

Now, we need to submit it to localhost on port 30000. To connect to it we use the `netcat` utility, by running the command 

```
nc localhost 30000
```

we then submit the password for bandit14 and get the password for bandit15 as output.
