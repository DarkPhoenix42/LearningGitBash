We first change our working directory to inhere and after running ls, conclude that there are a lot of directories each with a lot of files in them. Our goal is to find a file that satisfies the following conditions

> Size ; 1033 bytes
> Non-execuatable
> Human-readable

To find all the files that are 1033 bytes we run the command

> du -b -a | grep 1033

du is a utility to calcluate file sizes. The -a flag tells it to recursively list all files and -b tells it to list the size in bytes.

After the running this command , we find out that the only file satisfying the condition is ./maybehere07/.file2. We verify that it is readable by running 

> file ./maybehere07/.file2 | grep ASCII

We get the password to the next level when we cat this file.
