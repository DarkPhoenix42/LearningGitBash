The goal of this level is to read a file named **"-"**.

We first ssh into the server using the command

```
ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

and enter the password found in the previous level i.e **NH2SXQwcBdpmTEzi3bvBHMM9H66vVXjL**.

When we try to read the file using 

```
cat -
```

we encounter an issue as cat treats the "-" character specially, and starts reading from stdin instead of any file. 

This issue can be resolved in multiple ways.

1. We can specify that we want to read the file "-" by specifying the full path to the file i.e **./-**
```
cat ./-
```

2. We can also use other file reading utilities like more that do not treat "-" as a special character.

```
more -
```

..etc

We finally find the password to the next level as **rRGizSaX8Mk1RTb1CNQoXTcYZWU6lgzi**
