The goal of this level to find all the ports that are active and support SSL on the localhost in the port range 31000-32000. To scan these ports, we use the `nmap` utility.

```
nmap localhost -p 31000-32000
```

We get a few ports that are active. We now find what service they are running by using the `-sV` flag with nmap. 

```
nmap -sV localhost -p p1,p2,p3.. 
```

We find the port that is running ssl and use the command

```
openssl s_client -connect localhost:<port_number>
```

and submit the password to this level to get the private key for the next level.
