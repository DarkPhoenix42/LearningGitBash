The goal of this level is to read a file with spaces in it's name called "spaces in this filename".

After logging into the server using ssh, when we try reading this file using 

> cat spaces in this filename

we get the following error.

> cat: spaces: No such file or directory
> 
> cat: in: No such file or directory
> 
> cat: this: No such file or directory
> 
> cat: filename: No such file or directory

This is because cat thinks we are passing it the names of four separate files **spaces**, **in**, **this**, **filename**. To avoid this we need to enclose the entire filename in quotes to specify that we only want to read one file with that name.

Hence we use

> cat "spaces in this filename"

We finally get the password for the next level as **aBZ0W5EmUfAf7kHTQeOwd8bauFJ2lAiG**
