The goal of this level is to find a file that is

```
owned by user bandit7
owned by group bandit6
has size 33 bytes
```

We can find all the files satisfying these conditions using a single command i.e

```
find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 
```

The "/" specifies that we want to search from the filesystem root directory, the `-type f` selects only files, the `-user` and `-group` flags are used to specify the owner user and group respectively and the `-size 33c` filters the files to only include ones that store 33 bytes.

But along with the required output this command prints a lot of **Permission denied** error messages. We can redirect all these error messages to /dev/null by appending **2>/dev/null** at the end of this command.
We then find that our required file is **/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password**. We get the password to the next level by reading this file.
