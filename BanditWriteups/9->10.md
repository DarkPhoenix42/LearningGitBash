The goal of this level is to find a human readable string that is preceded by several `=` characters in data.txt.

To find all the human readable lines in a file we run the `strings` command, passing the filename as argument. Since, we need to find a line with several `=` characters in it, we simply use grep and hence the final command becomes

```
strings data.txt | grep ==
```

We find the password to the next level as
