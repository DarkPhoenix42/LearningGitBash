The goal of this level is to read a hidden file in the **inhere** directory.

After sshing into the server, we first need to go to the **inhere** directory. To do this, we use the command

> cd inhere/

cd stands for Change Directory. The general syntax for cd is 

> cd /path/to/the/directory

After we are in the inhere directory we need to see all the files inside it, including hidden files. For this, we use the command 

> ls -a

ls is utility for listing files. We pass in the flag **-a** to specify that we want to list all files including hidden ones.

After running this, we find that there is hidden file called **.hidden**. We read it's contents using 

> cat .hidden

and find the password for the next level as 

**2EW7BBsr6aMMoJ2HjW067dm8EgX26xNe**.
