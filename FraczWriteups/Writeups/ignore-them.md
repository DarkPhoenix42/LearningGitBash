The goal of this level is to create a .gitignore file that ignores certain files like `.exe, .o. jar` and directories such as `libraries/`. So we create a .gitignore file containing the following lines

```
*.exe
*.jar
*.o
libraries/
```

and then we add `.gitignore` to the staging area and commit it.

We then verify that we have passed this level and move on to the next one.
