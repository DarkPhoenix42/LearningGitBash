The goal of this level is to find the only unique line in data.txt.
To do this, we make use of the uniq command. However, it only works on sorted input, so we need to sort the file first. So, we use the sort command on the file and pass the output to uniq command.

The uniq command by default, outputs all the different unique lines in the input, i.e it will remove the redundant lines and print the remaining ones. However, we want to remove all non-unique lines. To do this, we use the `-u` flag.

Hence the final command is 

> sort data.txt | uniq -u

We find the password to the next level as
