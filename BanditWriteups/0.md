To solve this level we need to ssh into the server at **bandit.labs.overthewire.org** on port **2220** as user **bandit0** with password **bandit0**. To do this we use the command

```
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

The general syntax is as follows

```
ssh <user>@<host> -p <port(default : 22)> 
```

When it prompts for the password we enter **bandit0** and with that, we have successfully logged in to the server and finished this level.
