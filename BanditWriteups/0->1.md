The goal of this level is to read the file **readme**. 

We first ssh into the server using the command

```
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
and enter the password bandit0.

We then use the cat command to achieve our goal.

```
cat readme
```

The general syntax is 

```
cat <file_name>
```

The output that we get is the password for the next bandit level.
