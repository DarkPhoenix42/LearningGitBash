The goal of this level is to obtained the original file from the hexdump of a file obtained after repeatedly compressing the original file.

We first reconstruct the file from the hexdump given, by using the `xxd` utility. We run the command 

> xxd -r data.txt data.bin

The `-r` flag indicates that we mean to reconstruct the data from the hex dump and not the other way around. We pass `data.txt` as input file and `data.bin` as output. 

We see that we get an error as we don't have permission to create new files in this directory. So, we create a new temporary directory at /tmp/kronos using the `mkdir` command i.e `mkdir /tmp/kronos/`. We then move data.txt to that directory by doing 
`mv data.txt /tmp/kronos/data.txt`. 

After reconstructin data.bin, we run the file command on it to see the type of file. We see that it is gzip compressed data. To decompress it, we first rename it to `data.gz` using the command `mv data.bin data.gz`. Then we decompress using the command `gzip -d data.gz`. 

We keep decompressing the files by first using the file utility to figure the compression used. If it is tar we use

> tar -xf \<filename\>

If it is bzip2 we use

> bzip2 -d \<filename\>

Finally we get an ASCII text file containing the password to the next level.
