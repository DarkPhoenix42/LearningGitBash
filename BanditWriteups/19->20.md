The goal of the level is to read the password at `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit20`. We see that there is a binary called bandit20-do which is owned by user `bandit20` and has the setuid bit set. That means we can run any command as bandit20. So we run 

``` 
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
```
